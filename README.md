Learning and exploring Go!

### Udemy Course
Most of these contents are from Udemy's [Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide) course. There is usually a sale that drops the price down to $15-18, so keep an eye out for that, otherwise it is originally $100.

10/30/2025: Completed the course! See my *shiny* certificate.
